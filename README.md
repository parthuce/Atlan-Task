# Rule Validation Service

## Overview

The Rule Validation Service is designed to validate data collected from various sources in the form of JSON. The validation process is based on user- or client-configured rules that are stored in a database. The service parses these rules corresponding to the input JSON form to ensure that the data meets the specified criteria.

## Core Functionality

- **Rule Parsing & Validation**: The service checks the incoming JSON data against the rules stored in the database. If any rule is violated, the service flags the specific field where the violation occurred, allowing users to understand exactly where the issue lies.

- **Incident Logging**: All rule violations are stored in the database, enabling detailed reporting on which fields contain invalid data. This helps users identify and correct errors efficiently.

- **User Feedback**: Though currently basic, the system can be enhanced to show users exactly which rule was violated and what the expected values should be. This provides clearer guidance on how to correct their data.

- **Complex Logic Handling**: The service includes basic examples of handling composite rules using logical operators like AND and OR (Composite Pattern). However, there is significant scope for improvement in handling more granular and complex validation logic suitable for production-level code.

## Extensibility

The code is designed with extensibility in mind, offering a foundation that can be built upon. Some potential enhancements include:

- **Date Operators**: Integrating operators that work specifically with date-related rules.
- **Composite Operators**: Combining different rules using operators such as `LessThanOrEqual`, which could be implemented as an OR rule combining `LessThanRule` and `EqualRule`.
- **Advanced Rule Composition**: Extending the current abstractions to support more sophisticated rule compositions and validations.

## Conclusion

While the current implementation provides a solid starting point, there is considerable room for further development and refinement. By extending the core abstractions, you can build a more robust and feature-rich rule validation system.
